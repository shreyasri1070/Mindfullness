MentalHealthApp is a comprehensive mental health application built using the MERN stack. It offers several features to help users manage their mental well-being, including cookie session login, a mood tracker, an AI therapist, a mood quiz, and anonymous sharing.

## Features

### Cookie Session Login
- Secure user authentication using cookie sessions to maintain user login states across different sessions. So also with an unauthorised acces you can't access certain pages of the application. 

### Mood Tracker
- Tracks your daily mood and logs it in the database, allowing users to monitor their mental health over time.

### AI Therapist
- Chat with an AI therapist to discuss your feelings and get instant responses. This feature uses the Gemini API for natural language processing to provide helpful advice and support.

### Mood Quiz
- Take a quiz to understand your current mood better. The responses are analyzed using the Gemini API, and a personalized feedback report is generated based on your answers.

### Anonymous Sharing
- Share your thoughts and feelings anonymously with the community. This feature ensures that users can express themselves freely without revealing their identity.

- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user management and article management, allowing users to manage their profiles and content seamlessly.
